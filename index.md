### Information

#### Who we are?

The community of Quality Assurance and Coding Standards for Parallel Software community aims to be an international group of researchers and other stakeholders from national laboratories, academic institutions, and industry who are interested in (and concerned about) quality assurance and best practices for the development of parallel software on a wide range of hardware architectures. 

#### Why is it important?

The automation of testing is critical in software development to improve quality assurance (QA), but today 80% of testing is manual and $32 billion is spent annually on QA. Coding standards in automotive and cybersecurity provide developers with rules and recommendations to prevent faulty code patterns. The ever-increasing complexity of HPC software and hardware pushes the developers to critically reevaluate testing methods, but there is no coding standard for parallel programming yet. The goal is to form a community interested in quality assurance and best practices for parallel programming.
